## Introduction

Airbnb is one of the most popular online community marketplace for people ('hosts) to list properties, book experiences and discover places. Hosts are reponsible for setting prices for the listings. It is hard for newcomers to set an accurate price to compete with other experience hosts.

As one of the most popular cities in Europe, London has over 80,000 listings as of May 2019. In such fierce competition environments, it is important to know which factors driving the price of listings. In this post, we will perform data analysis to extract useful insights about rental landscape in London. 
And applying machine learning models to predict the price for listings in London. The questions that will be addressed in this project are:

1. How is the demand for Airbnb changing in London?

3. Whcih boroughs are more expensive,  and which areas have the best reviews?
4. What are the factors that influence pricing on Airbnb listings?
